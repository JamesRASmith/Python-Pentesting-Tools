## Socket Functions

##Used to create a socket
#sock = socket.socket(socket_family,sockey_type)

##Create a stream socket
#sock = socket.socket (socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

#AF_INET
##Socket Family (here Address Family version 4 or IPv4)

#SOCK_STREAM
##Socket type TCP connections

#SOCK_DGRAM
##Socket type UDP connections

#gethostbyname("host")
##Translate a host name to IPv4 address format

#socket.gethostbyname_ex("host")
##Translate a host name to IPv4 address format, extended interface

#socket.getfqdn("8.8.8.8")
##Get the fqdn (fully qualified domain name)

#socket.gethostname()
##Returns the hostname of the machine.

#socket.error
##Exception handling


##Incredibly simple port scanner that simply tells me open and closed ports on
## a network

##Importing all of the required modules for the project
import socket
import subprocess
import sys
from datetime import datetime

##Variable to count number of open ports
OpenPorts = 0

##Firstly, I need to clear the screen from any previous scans
subprocess.call('clear', shell=True)

##Need to obtain an IP address to scan from the user

RemoteServer = input("Enter the target IP: ")
####This transaltes a host name to the IPv4 format for the program to understand.
RemoteServerIP = socket.gethostbyname(RemoteServer)

##Something for the user to view what IP is currently being scanned by the
## program
print ("*******************************************")
print ("* Please wait, scanning IP: ", RemoteServer,   "*")
print ("*******************************************")

##Inspiration from Nmap
##Check at what time the scan started
Time = datetime.now()

##To start I will set the program to scan ports 1-100 as a test and work from
## there

##Use a range function to achieve this
try:
    ##Ports 1 - 1000 are scanned
    for port in range(1,1000):
        ## This command creates a stream socket that allows data to be passed
        ## through
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        ##Returns the value 0 is the above operation is completed.
        ##This then  triggers the next part of the code
        result = sock.connect_ex((RemoteServerIP, port))
        if result == 0:
            print("Port {}: Open".format(port))
            OpenPorts = OpenPorts + 1
        sock.close()

##If the user presses the key combination of 'Ctrl + C' then the scan is stopped
## and the following code is executed
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Stopping scan!")
    ##Check how long the scan has taken
    Time2 = datetime.now()

    ##Calculation for length of scan
    Time = Time2 - Time

    ##Calculation for length of scan
    print("Scan Completed in: ",Time)

    ##Number of open ports found
    print("Number of open ports: ",OpenPorts)
    
    sys.exit()

##If the program cannot resolve the IP then the following message is displayed
except socket.gaierror:
    print("hostname could not be resolved. Exiting")
    sys.exit()

##If the program cannot connect to the server then the following message is
## displayed
except socket.error:
    print("Could not connect to server")
    sys.exit()

##Check how long the scan has taken
Time2 = datetime.now()

##Calculation for length of scan
Time = Time2 - Time

print("Scan Completed in: ",Time)
print("Number of open ports: ",OpenPorts)
